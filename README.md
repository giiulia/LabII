# Lab II projects  <sub>(course taken during the second year of BSc in Physics)</sub>
Group experiences in university laboratories have given rise to detailed reports that exist thanks to the work of
- Data Store
- Data Analysis
- Result Display
all developed with C++ scripts that reqire the use of CERN ROOT libraries. 

Each experience and so the relative report faces up the main phenomena of the topic of inquiry.
The topics of this year's course:
## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the prism and the graticule. Each set of data has been stored differently, such as the virtual ones', in [Spettrometer](./#1:Spectrometer) are visible all sections and the relative data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#1:Spettromentro/relazione_spettrometro.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#1:Spectrometer/relazione_spettrometro.tex)

## The Interferometer
