# Lab II projects
Lab II is a laboratory course I took in my second year in BSc in Physics.
This is a collection of 6 distinct group experiences in university laboratories. Each project has been carefully reported and commented.
As it happens, the following process is necessary to complete the task:
- Data Store
- Data Analysis
- Result Display
For each of these experiences, C++ scripts have been developed to meet the need.

Each experience and so the relative report faces up the main phenomena of the topic of inquiry.
The topics of this year's course:
## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the prism and the graticule. Each set of data has been stored differently. We carried out part of the project virtually therefore we labeled some data "virtual".

In [Spettrometer](./#1:Spectrometer) are visible all sections and the relative data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#1:Spettromentro/relazione_spettrometro.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#1:Spectrometer/relazione_spettrometro.tex)

## The Interferometer
